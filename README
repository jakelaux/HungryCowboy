This was my first soup to nuts game! The theme was growth which for some reason inspired me to make a lil' game about a coyboy who can absorb bullets and spit them back at his enemies. 
A lot of firsts in this project> First time using godot for not a tutorial, first time churning out this much pixel art (everything except the ghosts), first time actually pulling music off my OP1, and first time participating in a game jam!

Please feel free to leave comments and / or pointers and have a wonderful day!

The Ghosts were purchased from Pop Shop Packs and recolored to fit the palette of the project
